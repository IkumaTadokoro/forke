# Forke

Forke is a simple CLI tool designed to measure development productivity from GitHub info.

## Install

```bash
# Install
npm install -g forke

# This npm requires GITHUB_TOKEN, so please set it in the environment variable in any way.
export GITHUB_TOKEN='...'
```

## Concepts

This tool is designed to measure Four Keys, a development productivity indicator.

Measuring the Four Keys is not enough; it is important to link the results of the measurement to improvements. For this reason, a `stat` command is provided to retrieve the indicators and a `list` command to output the original data of the indicators.
The user of the tool is expected to see from the results of the list command which work of the development team is the bottleneck when each indicator is bad.

### Lead time for changes & Deployment frequency

```
[BaseBranch]                                                    to LeadTimeBranch |  to DeployBranch |
|---------------------------------- lead time ------------------------------------|--   No Stat    --|
|-- timeFromCommitToOpen --|-- timeFromOpenToReview --|-- timeFromReviewToMerge --|------------------|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^                          ^                          ^                           ^                  ^
first commit        create PullRequest            first review              merge PullRequest       release
```

- **Deployment frequency = Number of PullRequests targeting DeployBranch**
- **Lead time for changes = timeFromCommitToOpen + timeFromOpenToReview + timeFromReviewToMerge.**
  - As shown in the figure, the time between the merge and the deployment is not captured by Forke.
  - As the deployment process is heavily influenced by the business side, I have decided that it is not possible to drill down from the GitHub data and have used this specification, but I may make it possible to obtain this information in the future.

### Change failure rate & Time to restore service

- **Change failure rate = (Number of PullRequests targeting LeadTimeBranch and head is hotfixBranch) / (Number of PullRequests targeting LeadTimeBranch)**
- **Time to restore service = Average(Lead time of PullRequests targeting LeadTimeBranch and head is hotfixBranch)**
  - The Lead ã€€ time calculation method is the same as for calculating lead time for changes.

## Usage

### List PullRequests

List merged pull requests that match the search conditions are output to standard output.

```bash
npx forke list --query ...
```
